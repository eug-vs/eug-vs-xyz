# Жыве Беларусь! :belarus:

Belarus citizens meet a lot of hatred outside the country. But are not the same as our government!


## Current situation
Most people in Belarus are against the regime. Actual support of Lukashenko in 2020 was ~3%.

Elections were stolen! Our freedom is stolen! People were fighting against it, but [the protests were brutally stopped by a bloody regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Belarusian_protests).

## Goergia :georgia:
And here I am, writing this from T'bilisi, Georgia :georgia: , **forced** to leave my country.

Belarussian government supports Russia's war. But no citizen in Belarus does, and no one wants to fight against our brothers in Ukraine :ukraine:, myself included. If you are Georgian, please think about it when blaming random people on the streets.

# Improving my password management with pass
I've been a long time user of [Bitwarden :bitwarden:](https://bitwarden.com), and it's been a fascinating experience. But it's time to switch to a more based and minimal password manager - [pass](https://passwordstore.org).

## Bitwarden :bitwarden:
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is one of the greatest password managers out there - it's open source and can be self-hosted, it is available as browser extension and an mobile app, there's also a CLI for it. This is the password manager I can trust enough to actually recommend to my friends. But for my personal use, it's time to say goodbye to Bitwarden since I'm switching to a more minimal `pass`.

## Pass
[Pass](https://passwordstore.org) by ZX2C4 (the same guy who wrote [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/)) is so simple that it's not even funny. This is when you realize how little is needed to actually meet requirements of a good password manager. But here's what I'd highlight about `pass`:
1. GnuPG for encryption
2. Plain Unix directory structure
3. Built-in `git` support (`USE=git`)

### Migrating passwords from Bitwarden
There are tons of import utilities featured on the pass website, and all major password managers are supported. I just exported my Bitwarden data and had my `~/.password-store/` ready in a couple of seconds. I haven't yet come up with a proper directory organization, but for now I just put everything web-related under `www/` directory.

### Pass menu
On Gentoo enabling `USE=dmenu` will add a `passmenu` binary that is a simple [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) script. It's mega useful - there's no quicker way to search & copy your password than this.

### Browser extension
Firefox browser extension (`pass-ff`) works great on my Librewolf :librewolf:. Unfortunately there's no `USE=librewolf` flag for `www-plugins/passff-host` (although upstream supports it) so I had to manually symlink `/usr/lib64/mozilla/native-messaging-hosts -> /usr/lib64/librewolf/native-messaging-hosts/`

The GUI could be a bit better but it does the job and that's all that matters. Autofill works perfectly.

### Android application
I was always concerned about the experience on my Android phone. But turns out it's not so bad - installing [OpenKeyChain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) to manage my GPG key and [Android Password Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/) as the `pass` client yields a pretty good UX for me. In some cases I find that this app works even better than Bitwarden for Android - autofill stuff takes less time to appear and is much more consistent.

## Conclusion
I'm happy I made this switch. This is yet another tiny improvement in my daily toolbox :hammer_and_wrench: that will make my workflows a bit more comfy and suck less.

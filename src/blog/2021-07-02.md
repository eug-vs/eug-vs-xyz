# My plans for this website
Welcome to [eug-vs.xyz](https://eug-vs.xyz)! This is my personal website where I plan to set up a bunch of cool things, namely:
 - SearX instance
 - Email server (*already up and running!*)
 - [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org) server
 - This blog
 - Knowledge base

I decided that I will write content for this website in `Markdown`, since it's the way of writing I am already so used to.
I use [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for writing and then I just pipe my `.md` files into `pandoc` which gives me nice static web pages. No bullshit, ads, trackers or client-side JavaScript here.

# Structure
Vimwiki provides a very good notes structure out of the box: you have your **main wiki** and **diary**:
 - **Main wiki** will be represented as a knowledge base, where I'll put things that I consider important and worth being indexed
 - **Diary** will form this blog - where I'll put everything that does not fit into the main wiki but still worth sharing

This way I can keep my writing workflow the same, I don't have to switch to the new patterns or anything else.

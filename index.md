# About me
I'm **Eugene** - software developer, enthusiast, free spirit and a cool guy. Here I share information based on my experience in different topics. I'm interested in tech, math, privacy, linguistics, nutrition, health, psychology and philosophy.

# About this website
This website runs on my local [Raspberry Pi :raspberry-pi:](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) along with many other services.

It's nothing more than a series of interlinked wiki pages that I write in **Markdown** :markdown: when I'm too lazy to do something productive. Checkout more info on my [blog post](/blog/2021-07-02.md).

No bullshit, ads, trackers or client-side JavaScript here.

# My projects
I enjoy writing software, from fullstack web applications to 3D renderers in low-level languages. I'm also building my home [infrastructure](https://git.eug-vs.xyz/eug-vs/infrastructure/).

You can find my projects on my [:git: git server](https://git.eug-vs.xyz).

# You should start using `ssh-copy-id` now!
Over the last couple of weeks I had to simultaneously manage up to 4 virtual machines in the Cloud. Holy shit, I've lost so much time just trying to log into them - picking up the correct server IP, then finding the password for it, and then finally `ssh`-ing into it. That's such a painful process, especially when you have to repeat it over and over again.

Luckily, there's a solution! Simply run `ssh-copy-id username@password` (the same way you would do with `ssh`, just replacing it by `ssh-copy-id`), enter your password and it will remember it. Of course you gotta have your keys set up, but I think everyone has.

Well, as a bonus, to not mess with the IPs, you can also use `~/.ssh/config` like that:
```bash
Host <alias>
  HostName <server ip>
  User <username>
```
You might guess what it's doing: running `ssh <alias>` will now expand to `ssh <username>@<server-ip>`!

Of course you can add as much hosts as you want to your config. Combined with `ssh-copy-id`, you get a perfect solution for managing multiple web servers.

## PS
If you are familiar with `tmux`, I highly recommend installing it right away on your server, and doing everything in a session. Even simple `tmux new` / `tmux a` will make your life even more easy!

# Here comes my git server :fire:
I've mirrored all of my important projects from GitHub :github: (along with some unpublished ones) to my personal git server: https://git.eug-vs.xyz

It includes:
 - My [dotfiles](https://git.eug-vs.xyz/eug-vs/dotfiles/)
 - My builds of [suckless sotftware](https://suckless.org)
 - [Source code](https://git.eug-vs.xyz/eug-vs/eug-vs-xyz/) for this website
 - My [homelab infrastructure](https://git.eug-vs.xyz/eug-vs/infrastructure/) (subject for upcoming blog post)
 - And [more](https://git.eug-vs.xyz)...

I'm using [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) as a web fronted to it. There still is some misconfiguration here and there, but it works. Check it out!
